  This section looks at which artists the ‘world’s biggest village’ has produced and what they have gone on to achieve in the music industry across the world as well as their humble beginnings. </p>
  <p>Starting with the biggest band to come out of Britain in the 21st century, Arctic Monkeys.  The four-piece formed in High Green and played their first ever gig at The Grapes pub in 2003. Since then the band have had the fastest selling debut album of all-time, become the only band to score five consecutive UK number one albums whilst on an independent label, headlined Glastonbury twice and constantly changed with the times. Over the years some of Alex Turner and co.’s most monumental gigs have happened in the steel city, they sold out The Leadmill in January 2006, the day before they released their record breaking debut album, performing the classic in full. In 2011, the Arctic’s played two sold-out nights at the recently re-opened Don Valley Bowl, supported by The Vaccines and Miles Kane as well as Sheffield’s Dead Sons, it was a sort-of mini festival celebrating Sheffield’s favourite sons.</p>

<p>
  One man who was on everybody’s lips who’s involved in the music scene who we talked to when asked who their favourite Sheffield musician is was ex-Longpigs frontman and all-round Sheffield legend, Richard Hawley. Hawley who has collaborated with the likes of Pulp and Arctic Monkeys was born in Pitsmoor in 1967 and first gained fame in the 90’s as guitarist in brit-poppers Longpigs who were active from 1993 until 2000. The band released two albums both charting in the UK top 40. However; Hawley is treated like a God within the music community in the Sheffield for his solo work. He has released seven studio solo albums, earning the Pitsmoor man two prestigious mercury nominations as well as earning him an army of fans. At the 2006 mercury prize where Hawley lost out to Sheffield’s Arctic Monkeys, front-man Alex Turner said during his acceptance speech ‘Someone call 999, Richard Hawley’s been robbed.’ Hawley’s biggest Sheffield gig to date came in 2015 when he headlined the Arena while touring his most recent album ‘Hollow Meadows.’ </p>
  <p>The Human League are one of the nation’s favourite pop bands with global hit ‘Don’t You Want Me’ selling over 1.55 million records in the UK alone. The band were described in 1978 by David Bowie to NME as ‘the future of pop music’ and nearly 40-years later they are still touring and releasing great new music. Sheffield has a rich history of pop music with The Human League being at the forefront of this scene alongside Heaven 17 and ABC. The band have released nine studio albums, five of which charted in the UK top 10 and sold over 20-million worldwide. </p>
    <p>Another band who were born in Sheffield is brit-pop legends Pulp, despite forming while at school in 1978 when they were teenagers, the band didn’t find success until the mid-90’s with albums ‘His ‘n’ Hers’ which was topped by 1995’s ‘Different Class’ which included the singles ‘Common People’ and ‘Disco 2000’ which sent the band into a new stratosphere of popularity.  This would be followed up by another number one record ‘This is hardcore’ they then embarked on a hiatus before returning with their final album in 2001. The band re-united between 2011 and 2013 which saw them tour the world, headline Reading and Leeds festival before finishing off playing a sold-out hometown gig in 2013 at Sheffield Arena where they were joined by Richard Hawley.

  ‘Up where we belong’ singer Joe Cocker was born in Sheffield in 1944 and had a career spanning almost 50 years before passing away in 2014. Joe Cocker signed his first recording contract at the Frog and Parrot pub on Division Street then called the Prince of Wales. This inspired young Sheffield band Redfaces to sign their first record label in the same pub last year as a tribute to their hero Cocker. During the span of Cocker’s career he amassed a total of nine UK Top 40 singles in his career and released 22 studio albums. Cocker won many awards in his vast career including two Grammy wins. One for Best Pop Performance in 1981 for ‘Up Where We Belong’ and the second was an induction of his cover of ‘With a Little Help from My Friends’ into the prestigious Hall of Fame in 2001.

<p>
Jon McClure aka ‘The Reverend’ alongside some of Sheffield’s most talented musicians such as Milburn frontman Joe Carnall make up Reverend and The Makers.  The band have scored an impressive five UK Top 20 albums and have been stalwarts on the British indie scene for over a decade.  Their last album ‘Mirrors’ was critically acclaimed and was described by Noel Gallagher as sounding ‘like nothing I’ve heard since the great concept albums of the ‘60s.’ and by Libertines frontman Carl Barat as a ‘magnum opus.’  The Sheffield five-piece are playing the first gig at the Don Valley Bowl since Arctic Monkeys in 2011 this June with Milburn, selling over 7,000 so far.

<h2>Sheffield’s music venues</h2>
  <!-- <div class="tumble one"></div> -->
<p>The Leadmill started off as an arts and music collective by a group of friends over 35 years ago and has evolved over time into one of the most famous indie venues in Britain. Bands such as Oasis, The Stone Roses, Royal Blood, The Strokes and Kings of Leon have performed at this holy grail for indie bands. Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos told Arcade Fire that playing The Leadmill was a ‘right of passage.’ Artists set to perform there in the coming months include The Amazons and Billy Bragg.</p>
<p>The O2 Academy is a 2,300-capacity venue that was opened in 2008 with a gig by Sheffield’s very own Reverend and The Makers. It has staged performances from a whole wealth of talent such as The Prodigy, The Black Keys and Elbow. Before becoming the O2 Academy the venue opened as the Top Rank Suite in 1968 and held legendary gigs from the likes of David Bowie and The Clash. In the 80s the venue became Roxy which was infamous in the pop scene and was an integral part of Sheffield’s night culture for the decade.</p>
<p>Sheffield City Hall is a Grade II listed building placed in the heart of the city centre that first opened its doors in 1932. The Beatles performed four nights at the venue in 1963 the same year that The Rolling Stones also performed at the venue. David Bowie, Queen, Pink Floyd and Fleetwood Mac have all also graced the City Hall stage. </p>

<p>The Harley since opening in 2003 has been a place for emerging bands to hone their craft and has established itself as one of the cities favourite venues. Every Thursday night it hosts a night showcasing Sheffield’s new music, they’ve also held gigs from artists such as Arctic Monkeys, The xx and Alt-J. The venue has gained a reputation for itself for food with Twisted Burger Company making sure Sheffield’s meat lovers never go hungry.</p>
<p>Sheffield Arena is the biggest indoor venue in South Yorkshire with a capacity for gigs of 13,500. It cost £34 million to build and was opened in 1991 with a performance from Paul Simon. Bands who’ve played at smaller venues in the city like The Leadmill such as Oasis, Arctic Monkeys and Kings of Leon have all gone on to sell-out the arena. Pulp performed their last ever gig at this venue in 2013 where they were joined onstage by Richard Hawley.
